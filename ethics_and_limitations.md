## Ethics and Limitations

### Data Limitations
This study relies on aggregated national-level data for crimes against women and female labor force participation in India. As a result, it does not capture regional, socio-economic, or demographic heterogeneity across states or districts.

### Reporting Bias
Crime data may be influenced by underreporting, changes in legal definitions, and improvements in reporting mechanisms over time. Therefore, observed trends may partially reflect reporting behavior rather than true incidence.

### Correlation vs Causation
The statistical analyses identify associations between female labor force participation and reported crimes against women. These results do not imply causality, and omitted variables such as education, urbanization, policing intensity, and economic growth may influence both variables.

### Ethical Use
All datasets used are publicly available and anonymized. No individual-level data was accessed or processed. The analysis is intended for academic and policy-oriented discussion only.
